# NModbus-CSharp
source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsaELcKF-rE

By using NModbus, we can both send and receive data to Modbus Slave. It is a simple application.

I wrote codes in Form1.cs, ReadHoldingRegisterForm.cs and ReadWordArrayFromModbusSlaveFrom.cs. The rest are the codes of the NModbus library.

In ModbusUtulity we add the ConvertUshortToFloatArray and ConvertFloatArrayToUshortArray methods.

Thank you Industrial Networks.
